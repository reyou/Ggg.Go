It's
time
to
get
organized.
So
far,
we've
been
throwing
all
our
code
together
in
a
single
file.
As
our
programs
grow
bigger
and
more
complex,
that's
going
to
quickly
become
a
mess.
In
this
chapter,
we'll
show
you
how
to
create
your
own
packages
to
help
keep
related
code
together
in
one
place.
But
packages
are
good
for
more
than
just
organization.
Packages
are
an
easy
way
to
share
code
between
your
programs.
And
they're
an
easy
way
to
share
code
with
other
developers.
